## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a healthcare dataset.  
The goal is to **clean, transform, and analyze** hospital data to gain business and operational insights.

---

## Objectives
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Identify and handle missing, duplicate, and incorrect values.
3. Convert data types (e.g., dates, numeric values).
4. Perform basic statistical analysis.
5. Visualize trends and patterns in the dataset.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** [Kaggle Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)
- **Rows:** 55,500 before cleaning and 50,000 after cleaning
- **Description:** Contains 15 columns including patient details, admission/discharge dates, medical conditions, and billing information.
